# whisked
collection game made for SIP + athena. Made with the p5play and p5js library.

## What's the deal?
You are a chef, trying to make it in the food industry; BUT first you must prove that you truly can make delicious meals. Watch out for the pesky rats that try to sneak into your food...they tend to spawn randomly and collect as many good ingredients as you can!

## How to Play
(Instructions are also included in-game)
1. Choose your recipe (sushi = easy, cake = medium, ramen = hard)
2. Let the ingredients fall! Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your chef side to side catch as many good ingredients as you can, while avoiding the rats
3. Get graded on your cooking skills!

## Deployment
1. Fork this repo
2. Go to Vercel, login, go to Overview, click Add New and click Project
3. Link the forked Github repo and import it to the project
4. Click Continue to Dashboard and your all done!
